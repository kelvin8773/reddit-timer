## About This Project

I implemented this project in the context of a course at [ooloo.io](https://ooloo.io/). This course mimics a professional real-world development environment.

Designs were provided via [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/). The project was split into small tasks using [Asana](https://app.asana.com/) as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task. The code was reviewed line by line by [Johannes](https://jkettmann.com/author/johannes/), a senior developer.

In this project I have been exposed to many practical techniques that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. Examples as following but not limit to: 

* **Creating pixel-perfect designs**
* **Planning and implementing a [complex UI component](https://github.com/ooloo-io/reddit-timer-kelvin8773/blob/master/src/main/components/search/heatMap.js#L92)**
* **[Implement data fetching with error handling](https://github.com/ooloo-io/reddit-timer-kelvin8773/blob/master/src/main/components/search/searchResult.js#L37)**
* **Debugging inside an IDE**
* **[Writing integration tests](https://dev.to/jkettmann/inside-a-dev-s-mind-refactoring-and-debugging-a-react-test-2jap)**
* **Professional Git workflow with pull requests**
* **Code reviews**
* **Continuous integration**

I was free to choose any technical stack, packages, and coding styles to finish the project as long as I met the acceptance criteria of a given task. The only limitation was to use React.

The code reviews gave me insights into best practices to follow (see [this example](https://github.com/ooloo-io/reddit-timer-kelvin8773/pull/11#pullrequestreview-412073827)). I was able to learn a lot and evolve my front-end knowledge rapidly.

Inspired by some of the concepts introduced in this project I wrote up an article to teach other junior developers [how to get started writing tests for React applications](https://dev.to/kelvin9877/how-to-write-tests-for-react-in-2020-4oai). **This article was very well-received. It got 200+ reactions and was featured in the dev.to newsletter.**
