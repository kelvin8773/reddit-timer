## About This Project (To Read)

I have done this project with a course from [ooloo.io](https://ooloo.io/), which I build up the app with a given design from [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/), manage project progress at [Asana](https://app.asana.com/), and iterate every task on github with line by line code review from a senior developer [Johannes](https://jkettmann.com/author/johannes/), all of these are done in a way to mimic how an actual project is being done in a real world environment. 

Unlike most online courses out there, this course is focused on learning experiences rather than technical stacks.

I was free to choose whatever technical stacks, packages, and coding styles to finish the project( It does limit to React Framework only though). As long as I meet the criteria of a given task. 

Of course, there is [advice](https://github.com/ooloo-io/reddit-timer-kelvin8773/pull/11#pullrequestreview-412073827) would give to follow the best practices when I finished each task. That is how I can learn and evolved my knowledge of FrontEnd rapidly. 

In this project, I have been exposed to many practical technics that I wouldn't have chances to see otherwise. Such as pixel perfect matching (as Front End Developer), debuging in IDE, planning with [complex UI model](https://github.com/ooloo-io/reddit-timer-kelvin8773/blob/master/src/main/components/search/heatMap.js#L92), git flow and [testing in Front End project](https://dev.to/jkettmann/inside-a-dev-s-mind-refactoring-and-debugging-a-react-test-2jap). 

I am inspired by some of the concepts introduced in this project that I decide write up an article to tech others junior developer [how to get start to writes tests in React today](https://dev.to/kelvin9877/how-to-write-tests-for-react-in-2020-4oai). 

If you find this project is interesting to build or you like to experience what a Front End developer will experience in the real world, try to to Enroll the course in [ooloo.io](https://ooloo.io/) to see how it works out for you, Thanks!
